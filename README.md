‚è∞ cronik: A Golang-based scheduler for periodic, delayed, and retryable jobs with robust error handling.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Periodic Jobs**: Schedule jobs to run at regular intervals (e.g., every minute, hour, day).
- **Delayed Jobs**: Schedule jobs to run after a specified delay (e.g., 10 minutes from now).
- **Retryable Jobs**: Automatically retry jobs that fail, with configurable retry policies.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully and provide detailed error logs.
- **Concurrency Control**: Manage the number of concurrent jobs to optimize resource usage.
- **Job Prioritization**: Assign priorities to jobs to ensure critical tasks are executed first.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Support for cron expressions and other flexible scheduling options.
- **Persistence**: Save job states to a database to ensure jobs are not lost on application restart.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Monitor job execution and send alerts on failures or other important events.
- **Extensible**: Easily extend the scheduler with custom job types and scheduling strategies.

## üí° Usage

## üí° Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use `cronik` to schedule jobs:

1. **Import the package**:

   ```go
   import (
       "fmt"
       "time"
       "github.com/trinhminhtriet/cronik"
   )
   ```

2. **Create a new scheduler**:

   ```go
   scheduler := cronik.NewScheduler()
   ```

3. **Define a job**:

   ```go
   job := func() {
       fmt.Println("Job executed at", time.Now())
   }
   ```

4. **Schedule the job**:

   - **Periodic Job**: Schedule the job to run every minute.

     ```go
     scheduler.SchedulePeriodicJob(job, time.Minute)
     ```

   - **Delayed Job**: Schedule the job to run after a 10-minute delay.

     ```go
     scheduler.ScheduleDelayedJob(job, 10*time.Minute)
     ```

   - **Retryable Job**: Schedule the job with retry policy (e.g., retry up to 3 times with a 1-minute interval).

     ```go
     scheduler.ScheduleRetryableJob(job, 3, time.Minute)
     ```

   - **Interval Job**: Schedule the job to run at specific intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).
     ```go
     scheduler.ScheduleIntervalJob(job, 5*time.Minute)
     ```

5. **Start the scheduler**:

   ```go
   scheduler.Start()
   ```

6. **Stop the scheduler** (when your application is shutting down):
   ```go
   scheduler.Stop()
   ```
